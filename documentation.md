# PlayStation E-Commerce Website - Documentation

## Design Choices
The website features a **black background** to create a sleek, modern look that aligns with the PlayStation brand. White, **goldenrod, and gold accents** were chosen to contrast the dark background, ensuring readability and a premium aesthetic. The layout is simple and structured, making navigation easy for users looking to browse and purchase PlayStation products.

## JavaScript Features
JavaScript was used to enhance interactivity, including:
- **Dynamic product listings** that update when new products are added.
- **Form validation** for user inputs in the checkout process.
- **Interactive elements**, such as hover effects and a shopping cart that updates in real-time.

## Challenges and Solutions
One major challenge was ensuring **responsiveness** across different devices. This was solved using **CSS media queries**. Additionally, handling the shopping cart updates dynamically required managing **local storage**, which was successfully implemented after debugging asynchronous operations.

## Deployment Process
The website was deployed using **Netlify**:
1. The project was pushed to a **GitHub repository**.
2. Netlify was configured to connect to the repository for continuous deployment.
3. The build settings were verified, and the site was published at a custom **Netlify domain**.

This setup ensures seamless updates whenever new changes are pushed to GitHub.
